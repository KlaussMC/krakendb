# krakendb

The package contains a very basic method of managing what is essentially, a database.

The package can create, read, write and delete content in a very basic manner.

To install the package, type:

    npm install krakendb --save

To use:

    const krakendb = require("krakendb");

To create a database:

    krakendb.newdb();

 - this function takes two arguments, the name of the Database and the names of the rows.
 - The second argument can be an array of strings, if this is the case, all the row names will be named according to the array values.
 - If, however, this is not the case, and instead, an integer is provided, the rows will be named by number.
 - These are the only methods of naming rows. once this is set, this cannot be changed.

To add a new entry to the database:

    krakendb.newEntry();

 - This takes a single argument, the name of the entry.

To set an item:

    krakendb.setItem();

 - This function takes 3 arguments, the entry, item and value in that order.

 - The first argument specifies the entry to reference.
 - The second argument references the item, or the column, if the database is looked at in the form of a table.
 - The third argument is the value that the referenced item will be set to.

To retrieve an item:

    krakendb.getItem();

 - Takes 2 arguments, entry and optionally, item.

 - If only one argument is provided, returns whole entry in Array form
 - if both, returns string with value of referenced value.
 - Throws error if item doesn't exist to help with referencing.

To delete an item:

    krakendb.delItem();

 - Takes 2 arguments, entry and optionally, item.

 - If only one argument is provided, deletes whole entry in Array form
 - if both, deletes referenced value.

To switch databases:

    krakendb.activeDB();

 - Takes one argument, database name.

To load db from file:

    krakendb.loaddb();

    krakendb.dbexists();

 - takes one argument, db name. returns true if db exists either exported or unexported, false if otherwise.

    krakendb.indb()

 - takes one argument. checks whether string occurs in db.

 - argument 2 is optional

__New in version 1.6.0__

To change export location of databases:

    krakendb.setExportLocation()

 - takes one argument, location. The folder where the database files will be stored at + "/db".
    example: `krakendb.setExportLocation("C:\\Websites\\Test\\Info")` will store databased at `C:\\Websites\\Test\\Info\\db`
